The purpose for collecting data: BLM: The movement got a lot attention. During the Dutch elections, political parties use statements about #Blacklivesmatter in the campaigns (since there is a lot of rumor around it beginning from black pete).We will research the effect of these campaigns and statements on the public debate around #Blacklivesmatter with the hashtag on twitter in the Netherlands.
dprep research questions: We have created two datasets including data from 2020 and 2021. 
1) What are the differences in the amount of tweets before and after the Dutch elections?
2) How does the amount of tweets, including the #BLM, differentiates in different regions?
